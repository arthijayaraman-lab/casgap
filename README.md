# Computational Approach for Structure Generation of Anisotropic Particles (CASGAP)

## Introduction
`casgpap` package originally developed by Nitant Gupta, and Arthi Jayaraman is a method that generates structures of anisotropic particles which adhere to the user provided distributions of particle parameters. In the specific implementation, all particles are ellipsoidal (spheroidal) characterized by a volumetric radius $R$, an aspect ratio $\gamma$  and the orientation defined by a quaternion ${\theta_w, W}$.

The original code was written in MATLAB. With the help of Sri Vishnuvardhan Reddy Akepati at University of Delaware, a python version of the same code is also available.
